# Features of working with Java 8 (Part 1)
>This repository was created for homework in lessons â„–13 - "Features of working with Java 8 (Part 1)".
## Tasks

### Mandatory task:  
0. Get the day of the week by date.
1. Get the date of next Tuesday.  
2. Create a generalized functional interface.  
  Write a class with one method (think and justify the decision about whether it will be a static method or not).  
  In this method, implement the logic:  
    - if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use an interface with a string type and pass the line reversal logic (outputting the line in reverse order) to the interface method.  
    - if the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use an interface with an integer type and pass the logic for finding the factorial of the number to the interface method.
  
### Additional Tasks:
3. Implement an example of a singleton pattern (this is just an example with a private constructor).  
4. Implement an example of the immutable object pattern (this is what we discussed when we wanted to use our custom object as a key in a hash map).
5. Implement an example of a strategy pattern (we discussed this pattern when we looked at examples of polymorphism).
